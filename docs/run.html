<p>We've developed the Joined Node <code>/run/</code> endpoint to be flexible and quickly execute code:</p>

<pre><code class="hljs javascript">
HTTPS {verb} https://api.joinednode.com/run/{unique-container}/{recipe-id}
</code></pre>
<br />
<p>
<ol>
	<li><code>{unique-container}</code> identifies the <code>unique name</code> of the container to execute the request in.</li>
	<li><code>{recipe-id}</code> identifies the <code>unique id</code> of the recipe to execute. These recipes are added via the Joined Node Dashboard, and are associated with a single container.</li>
</ol>
</p>

	<h4>Now you Know...</h4>
	<p>The Joined Node recipe cluster may cache the recipe code obtained to reduce the latency of consecutive recipe requests.</p>
	<p>If you do decide that you not want any caching (for example, when you frequently modify the code during development), you can specify the <code>recipe_no_cache=1</code> URL query parameter when making the recipe request.</p>
	<p>Using this parameter will force the recipe cluster to ignore any cached version of the recipe code and instead get the newest version.</p>
</div>

<h4>HTTP Response Codes</h4>

<p>Regardless of how you decide to run the recipe code, the HTTP response has contains either the result of code execution or an error, depending on the status code of the response as follows:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>200</strong>: Code executed correctly and response contains the result of the recipe running.</li>
	<li><strong>400</strong>: There was a problem with the data submitted by the caller, the response body contains details.</li>
	<li><strong>403</strong>: The recipe is not submitted with the request or does not grant sufficient permissions.</li>
	<li><strong>429</strong>: Requests to the <code>{unique-container}</code> are throttled. The caller is expected to wait at least the amount of time specified in the <code>Retry-After</code> HTTP response header before re-attempting the request.</li>
	<li><strong>500</strong>: Fatal execution error of the recipe, the response contains details.</li>
</ul>
</p>
