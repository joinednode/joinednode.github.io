<div class="box effect8 well">
	<p>You are writing a mobile or web application that needs just a little bit of a backend. Maybe you want to access <a href="https://flybase.io">Flybase</a>, or MongoDB, process a Stripe payment, github webhook, send or receive an SMS, or an e-mail. Do you really need to host your own Node.js service to run this small snippet of backend logic?</p>
	<p>Meet Joined Node, We make it easier to securely execute node.js powered recipes directly from a mobile or web application. You donâ€™t need a backend to run backend code.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, an app needs a full backend system, and sometimes, it just needs a single, secure endpoint that you can call and have it perform a specific recipe.</p>

<p>Maybe you want to send an SMS message or an email, or maybe you want to save data in a database?</p>

<p>You could set up a full client / server environment for this, but is that really necessary?</p>

<h4>Meet Joined Node</h4>

<p>At the heart of <strong>Joined Node</strong>, are <em>Recipes</em>, a <em>Recipe</em> is a snippet of code that can be called using a simple HTTP request, either directly in a browser or anywhere else. These Recipes can be very simple, or they can be extended as much as you wish.</p>

<p>Joined Node brings you a whole new way to build your code, rather than the traditional, process of setting up servers, building out a full backend, you can instead focus on the frontend and use Joined Node to handle your backend work. All code is executed securely in a containerized sandbox environment, and our web-based IDE lets you rapidly build recipes, allowing you to integrate cleanly with single page web applications, mobile apps, regular HTML apps, etc.</p>

<p>These Joined Node Recipes are also known as <strong>microservices</strong>, each recipe does one job, and does it well. This also helps keep your code clean and organized, while also helping you build out your apps faster when you don't have to worry about huge backend systems.</p>

What makes microservices particularly attractive to development teams is their independence. Teams can work on a problem or group of problems on their own. This creates several attractive qualities favored by many developers:

Freedom to pick the right tool: Is that new library or development platform something you always wanted to use? You can (if it's the right tool for the job).
Quick iteration: Was the first version suboptimal? No problem, version 2 can be out the door in no time. Because microservices tend to be small, changes can be implemented relatively quickly.
Rewrites are a possibility: In contrast with monolithic solutions, since microservices are small, rewrites are a possibility. Was the technology stack the wrong pick? No problem, switch to the right alternative.
Code quality and readability: Isolated development units tend to be of higher quality and new developers can get up to speed with the existing code fairly easily.

<p>With Joined Node, we're recreating how you build your apps, rather than building huge monolithic backend services, you can focus on building singular microservices recipes that do one job and do it well. For example you want to send an email, just trigger a post to a recipe that sends an email with the information included, or if you want to send an SMS message, you can just build another Recipe to call.</p>

<p>This lets you securely, and rapidly build your apps</p>
