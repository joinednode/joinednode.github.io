<div class="box effect8 well">
	<p>You are writing a mobile or web application that needs just a little bit of a backend. Maybe you want to access <a href="https://flybase.io">Flybase</a>, or MongoDB, process a Stripe payment, github webhook, send or receive an SMS, or an e-mail. Do you really need to host your own Node.js service to run this small snippet of backend logic?</p>
	<p>Meet Joined Node, We make it easier to securely execute node.js powered tasks directly from a mobile or web application. You donâ€™t need a backend to run backend code.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, an app needs a full backend system, and sometimes, it just needs a single, secure endpoint that you can call and have it perform a specific task.</p>

<p>Maybe you want to send an SMS message or an email, or maybe you want to save data in a database?</p>

<p>You could set up a full client / server environment for this, but is that really necessary?</p>

<h4>Meet Joined Node</h4>

<p>At the heart of <strong>Joined Node</strong>, are <em>Tasks</em>, a <em>Task</em> is a snippet of code that can be called using a simple HTTP request, either directly in a browser or anywhere else. These Tasks can be very simple, or they can be extended as much as you wish. Their major benefits include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Ease of use. No complicated setup, just code.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Vastly simplifies / eliminates the need for backend code, boiling it down into reusable, functional pieces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Joined Node brings you a whole new way to build your code, rather than the traditional, process of setting up servers, building out a full backend, you can instead focus on the frontend and use Joined Node to handle your backend work. All code is executed securely in a containerized sandbox environment, and our quick IDE lets you rapidly build out tasks, allowing you to integrate cleanly with single page web applications, mobile apps, straight HTML apps, etc.</p>

<p>Joined Node Tasks can be used for...</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="icon fa-laptop"></span> <strong>Backendless Applications</strong>: >Focus on the frontend of your web or mobile applications, and let us handle the server-side.</li>
	<li><span class="icon fa-cog"></span> <strong>Programmable Webhooks</strong>: Run a task on each Twilio message, Stripe Payment, GitHub Push, Twilio message, email received, send email, or any type of webhook you might need, without setting up a single server.</li>
	<li><span class="icon fa-bar-chart-o"></span> <strong>Multi Tenant Sandbox</strong>: Allow your customers to extend your product using Node.js code instead of creating your own scripting language.</li>
</ul>							

<p>These Joined Node Tasks are also known as <strong>microservices</strong>, each task does one job, and does it well. This usually means that Tasks tend to avoid interdependencies: if one Task has a hard requirement for other Tasks, then you should ask yourself if it makes sense to make them all part of the same unit. This also helps keep your code clean and organized, while also helping you build out your apps faster when you don't have to worry about huge backend systems.</p>

<p>With Joined Node, we're recreating how you build your apps, rather than building huge monolithic backend services, you can focus on building singular microservices tasks that do one job and do it well. For example you want to send an email, just trigger a post to a task that sends an email with the information included, or if you want to send an SMS message, you can do the same.</p>
<p>This lets you securely, and rapidly build your apps</p>
