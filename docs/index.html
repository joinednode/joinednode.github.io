<h3>Get up and running in 30 seconds <em>or less</em></h3>

<p>Getting started with Joined Node is actually really simple, you just <a href="https://app.joinednode.com/signup">sign up</a>, and create your first <em>Task</em>.</p>

<div class="box effect8 well">
	<p><em>Tasks</em> are the heart of Joined Node, a <em>Task</em> is a snippet of code that can be called using a simple HTTP request, either directly in a browser or anywhere else. These Tasks can be very simple, or they can be extended as much as you wish.</p>
</div>

<p>When you sign up, you will get assigned a unique <em>container</em>, this is used to run your apps and all apps you create are associated with this container.

<h3>Creating your first task</h3>

<p>Once you've signed up, let's create a task called <code>hello world</code>:</p>

<div class="window-toolbar">
	<i class="fa fa-circle red"></i>
	<i class="fa fa-circle orange"></i>
	<i class="fa fa-circle green"></i>
	<span>hello.js</span>
</div>	
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">
module.exports = function(context, callback) { 
	callback(null, {message: "Hello " + context.data.who + '!' }); 
}
</code></pre>

<br />

<p>This will create a unique URL, which is based on your unique <em>container</em> and <em>task</em>, so you would see a URL similar to this:

<p><code>
https://api.joinednode.com/run/black-surf-17638/polished-firefly-55389
</code></p>

<p>Then, you would call it with: <code>https://api.joinednode.com/run/black-surf-17638/polished-firefly-55389?who=me</code> via curl, or from a web request, which would return a JSON result with <code>message</code> that says hello to the name you passed as <code>who</code>.</p>

<p>Joined Node Tasks use a slightly different <a href="/docs/model">programming model</a> than traditional node.js scripts do, mostly this is designed to help make creating your tasks quicker, while also giving you flexibility.</p>
