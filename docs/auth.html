<p>When you create a Task, you have the option of making it <code>public</code> or <code>private</code>.</p>

<p><code>Public</code> tasks are tasks that can be called via an HTTP request and don't require authentication.</p>

<p><code>Private</code> tasks are tasks that require authentication using a Joined Node token. The token can be provided either using the <code>Authorization</code> request header, or via the <code>token</code> URL query parameter.</p>

<p>Using the <code>Authorization</code> header is recommended as this prevents certain cases where your token can be cached by intermediate HTTP processors.</p>

<p>Unauthenticated requests will result in 403 responses.</p>

<p>Tokens can be presented with the <code>Authorization: Bearer {token}</code> HTTP request header.</p>

<p>Tokens can also be presented with the <code>token={token}</code> URL query parameter</p>
