At the heart of <strong>Joined Node</strong>, are <em>Tasks</em>, a <em>Task</em> is a snippet of code that can be called by using a simple HTTP request, either directly inside a browser, or from inside your code, <em>regardless of language or platform</em>.

These Tasks can be very simple, or they can be extended as much as you wish. Their major benefits include:

- <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Ease of use. No complicated setup, just code.
- <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Helps simplify or entirely eliminate the need for backend code, by boiling it down into reusable, functional pieces.
- <i class="fa fa-check"></i> A simple, lightweight, and, most importantly, secure way of running isolated backend code.
- <i class="fa fa-check"></i> A secure and cost efficient solution to the difficult challenge of supporting <strong>extensibility through custom code in multi-tenant systems</strong>.
- <i class="fa fa-check"></i> A Perfect fit for <strong>single page or mobile applications that need just a little bit of a backend</strong>.
- <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Finally, Joined Node Tasks serve as a flexible and lightweight mechanism that supports a variety of <strong>integration scenarios</strong>.


Joined Node was created and is supported by <a href="http://flybase.io">Flybase</a>. In fact, we are using Joined Node internally as a key element of our real-time app backend platform, which lets us in turn enhance your Joined Node experience as we tune and enhance it.
