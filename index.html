<div class="box effect8 well">
	<p>It's a familiar story. You get a great idea for an app, and start building it... <em>But wait...</em></p>
	<p>Do you really need the hassle of setting up an entire server when all you want to do is have an HTML page that sends an SMS message? or an email? or posts to your Slack channel?</p>
	<p>There needs to be a simpler way to do this...</p>
	<p><em><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" style="color:black !important; font-weight: 900 !important;"></i> This is where Joined Node comes in handy...</em></p>
</div>						
<p>At the heart of <strong>Joined Node</strong>, are <em>Tasks</em>, a <em>Task</em> is a snippet of code that can be called by using a simple HTTP request, either directly inside a browser, or from inside your code, <em>regardless of language or platform</em>.</p>

<p>These Tasks can be very simple, or they can be extended as much as you wish. You can use them to handle incoming SMS messages, send outgoing SMS messages or emails, send a notification to Slack, process Stripe payments, save to a database somewhere. The major benefits of using Joined Node Tasks include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Ease of use. No complicated setup, just code, and our handy easy to use web-based editor.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Simplify or entirely eliminate the need for backend code, by boiling it down into reusable, functional pieces.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> A simple, lightweight, and, most importantly, secure way of running isolated backend code.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> A perfect fit for <strong>single page or mobile applications that need just a little bit of a backend</strong>.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Finally, Joined Node Tasks serve as a flexible and lightweight mechanism that supports a variety of <strong>integration scenarios</strong> with other services such as Twilio, Flybase, Mandrill, you name it.</li>
</ul>

<p>These Joined Node Tasks are also known as <strong>microservices</strong>, each task does one job, and does it well. This also helps keep your code clean and organized, while also helping you build out your apps faster when you don't have to worry about huge backend systems.</p>

<p>Joined Node was created and is supported by <a href="http://flybase.io">Flybase</a>. In fact, we are using Joined Node internally as a key element of our real-time app backend platform, which lets us in turn enhance your Joined Node experience as we tune and enhance it.</p>
